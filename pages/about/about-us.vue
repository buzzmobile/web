    <p class="about-p">We are a small fish trying to make it easy for people to find and buy the best mobile contracts.</p>
    <p class="about-p">We search deals across various merchants then present those deals in a transparent and simple way so you can make an
      informed decision</p>
    <p class="about-p">We don't sell you anything directly and instead get paid a tiny portion by our affiliates when you click through at no
      extra cost to you.
